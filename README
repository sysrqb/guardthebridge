GUARD the Bridge - Android App used to manage ride requests for GUARD Dogs


REQUIREMENTS

  - Android 2.3.3 (Gingerbread)
  - Bouncycastle Provider 146 (bcprov-jdk16-146.jar)
  - Protocol Buffers 2.4.1 (protobuf-java-2.4.1.jar)
  - Android Support Package (android-support-v4.jar)


PRE-BUILDING

  - Add X.509 certificates to a keystore
    - To create the keystore, you must first generate a certificate that is
      signed by an authorized Certificate Authority. This may be your own
      self-signed CA or another, as long as it's trusted.
    - When you have the certificate, we then must import it into the keystore
    - From a command line (all on one line):

        $ keytool -importcert -v -trustcacerts -file
          "/path/to/certificate/pem/cacrt.pem" -alias ALIASOFCACERT -keystore
          "keyStore" -provider
          org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider -providerpath
          /path/to/bcprov-jdk16-146.jar -storetype BKS
          -storepass KEYSTOREPASSPHRASE

    - /path/to/certificate/pem/cacrt.pem is the path to the CA certificate
      - If you are setting up the environment with gtbserver, then the cert is
        probably in pem/certs/
    - /path/to/bcprov-jdk16-146.jar should be in libs/
    - ALIASOFCACERT is the alias you give to the new trusted certificate entry
    - KEYSTOREPASSPHRASE is the passphrase used to check integrity of keystore

    - You may verify the keystore was created successfully by running this from
      the command line (all on one line):
      
        $ keytool -list -keystore keyStore -provider
          org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider -providerpath
          /path/to/bcprov-jdk16-146.jar -storetype BKS -storepass
          KEYSTOREPASSPHRASE


BUILDING

  Open in Eclipse and add the the Bouncycastle, Protobuf, and Support Package
  libraries to the Build Path. Then Run.
